A lot of people think of rhetoric as a dirty word, but a long time agothink ancient
Greeceit was perhaps the noblest of arts. Jay Heinrichss book is a timely,
valuable, and entertaining contribution to its much-needed rehabilitation.
Ben Yagoda, author of About Town: The New Yorker and the World It Made
and The Sound on the Page: Great Writers Talk About Style and Voice in Writing
Knowing how to use the proper words is an art; knowing how to intersperse them
with savvy pauses is a mystery. Words are treacherous: they either explain or conceal.
And silence is all the more dangerous: speak too much and youve become
redundant; speak too little and youre ignored. But speak in just the right way and
then be quiet and youll be revered and esteemed. Jay Heinrichss superb modern
manual on rhetoric shows the extent to which we are what we sayand how.
Ah, the mysteries of the tongue!
Ilan Stavans, author of Dictionary Days: A Defining Passion
A rhetorical cocktail party where the guest list includes Cicero, Britney Spears,
Saint Augustine, and Queen Victoria. From MT V to Aristotle, Heinrichs entertains,
enlightens, and even teaches us a little Greek, persuading us that the big battles
and daily combats of work, love, and life can be won. If argument is the cradle of
thought, Thank You for Arguing can make us all better thinkers. So listen up!
Sarah McGinty, author of Power Talk: Using
Language to Build Authority and Influence
Reading Thank You for Arguing is like having a lively talk with the author about the
very backbone of real talk, the willingness of people to change each othersand
their ownideas through constructive argument. Writing with vividness and rigor,
Jay Heinrichs maps this territory so youll always know where you are. Youll
scratch your head, grit your teeth, smack your forehead, and laugh out loud as he
guides you through the landscape of differing with a difference.
Margaret Shepherd, author of The Art of Civilized Conversation:
A Guide to Expressing Yourself with Grace and Style
Who knew that a rhetorician could be a seducer, a swashbuckler, and a stand-up
comic? In this inspiring and original study, Jay Heinrichs illuminates the ways
in which we understand, enjoy, and infuriate each other, all the while instructing
us on ways to make certain everyone will be on our side. Heinrichss prose is not
only engaging, its hysterically funny. Aristotle would have loved him; so too John
Adams, Daniel Webster, and Abraham Lincoln; E. B. White would have become his
agent. Rhetoric doesnt get any better than this.

P R E FAC E
Few people can say that John Quincy Adams changed their lives. Those
who can are wise to keep it to themselves. Friends tell me I should also
avoid writing about my passion for rhetoric, the three-thousand-year-old art
of persuasion.
John Quincy Adams changed my life by introducing me to rhetoric.
Sorry.
Years ago, I was wandering through Dartmouth Colleges library for no
particular reason, flipping through books at random, and in a dim corner
of the stacks I found a large section on rhetoric, the art of persuasion.
A dusty, maroon-red volume attributed to Adams sat at eye level. I flipped it
open and felt like an indoor Coronado. Here lay treasure.
The volume contained a set of rhetorical lectures that Adams taught
to undergraduates at Harvard College from 1805 to 1809, when he was a
United States senator commuting between Massachusetts and Washington.
In his first class, the paunchy, balding thirty-eight-year-old urged his
goggling adolescents to catch from the relics of ancient oratory those
unresisted powers, which mould the mind of man to the will of the speaker,
and yield the guidance of the nation to the dominion of the voice. To me
that sounded more like hypnosis than politics, which was sort of cool in a
Manchurian Candidate way.
In the years since, while reading all I could of rhetoric, I came to realize
something: Adamss language sounded antique, but the powers he
described are real. Rhetoric means more than grand oratory, more than
using words . . . to influence or persuade, as Websters defines it. It teaches
us to argue without anger. And it offers a chance to tap into a source of
social power I never knew existed.
You could say that rhetoric talked me into itself.

not dressed for the part.
George! I yell. Who used all the toothpaste?
A sarcastic voice answers from the other side of the door. Thats not the

forces of history. Who wants to teach leadership when academia doesnt
believe in leaders? At the same time, English lit replaced the classics, and
ancient thought fell out of vogue. Nonetheless, a few
remarkable people continued to study the art. Daniel
Webster picked up rhetoric at Dartmouth by joining
a debating society, the United Fraternity, which
had an impressive classical library and held weekly
debates. Years later, the club changed its name to
Alpha Delta and partied its way to immortality by
inspiring the movie Animal House. To the brothers
credit, they didnt forget their classical heritage entirely;
hence the toga party.

we forgot it almost entirely. What a thing to lose. Imagine stumbling upon
Newtons law of gravity and meeting face-to-face with the forces that drive
the universe. Or imagine coming across Freud for the first time and suddenly
becoming aware of the unconscious, where your Id, Ego, and Superego
conduct their silent arguments.
I wrote this book for that reason: to lead you through this ill-known
world of argument and welcome you to the Persuasive Elect. Along the
way youll enhance your image with Aristotles three
traits of credible leadership: virtue, disinterest, and
practical wisdom. Youll find yourself using logic as a
convincing tool, smacking down fallacies and building
airtight assertions. Aristotles principles will also
help you decide which mediume-mail? phone? skywriting?

a simple strategy to get an argument unstuck
when it bogs down in accusation and anger.
And thats just the beginning. The pages to come
contain more than a hundred argument tools borrowed
from ancient texts and adapted to modern
situations, along with suggestions for trying the techniques
at home, school, work, or in your community.

should lean on an emotional strategy. Youll acquire mind-molding figures of
speech and ready-made tactics, including Aristotles irresistible enthymeme,
a neat bundle of logic that I find easier to use than pronounce.
By the end of the book you will have mastered the rhetorical tricks for
making an audience eager to listen. People still love a well-delivered talk;
the top professional speakers charge more per person than a Rolling
Stones concert. I devote a whole chapter to Ciceros elegant five-step
method for constructing a speechinvention, arrangement, style, memory,
and deliverya system that has served the greatest orators for the past
two thousand years.
Great argument does not always mean elaborate speech, though. The
most effective rhetoric disguises its art. And so Ill reveal a rhetorical device
for implanting opinions in peoples heads through sheer sleight of tongue.
Besides all these practical tools, rhetoric offers a grander, metaphysical
payoff: it jolts you into a fresh new perspective on the human condition.
After it awakens you to the argument all around, the world will never seem
the same.
I myself am living proof.
Ooh, Baby, Stir Harder
To see just how pervasive argument is, I recently attempted a whole day
without persuasionfree of advertising, politics, family squabbles, or any
psychological manipulation whatsoever. No one would persuade me, and I
would avoid persuading them. Heck, I wouldnt even let myself persuade
myself. Nobody, not even I, would tell me what to do.
If anyone could consider himself qualified for the experiment, a confirmed
hermit like me could. I work for myself; indeed, having dropped out
of a career in journalism and publishing, I work by myself, in a cabin a considerable
distance from my house. I live in a tiny village in northern New
England, a region that boasts the most persuasion-resistant humans on the
planet. Advertisers have nightmares about people like me: no TV, no cell
phone, no BlackBerry, dial-up Internet. Im commercial-free, a walking

As if.

of bed, but now I ignore it. I stare up at the ceiling, where the smoke detector
blinks reassuringly. If the smoke alarm detected smoke, it would alarm,
rousing the heaviest sleeper. The philosopher Aristotle would approve of
the smoke detectors rhetoric; he understood the power of emotion as a
motivator.
For the time being, the detector has nothing to say. But my cat does. She
jumps on the bed and sticks her nose in my armpit. As reliable as my watch
and twice as annoying, the cat persuades remarkably well for ten dumb
pounds of fur. Instead of words she uses gesture and tone of voicepotent
ingredients of argument.
I resist stoically. No cat is going to boss me around this morning.
The watch beeps again. I wear a Timex Ironman, whose name comes
from a self-abusive athletic event; presumably, if the watch works for a

argument from strength does not affect me, however. I
bought it because it was practical. Remember, Im advertising-immune.
But its beeping is driving me crazy. Here Im not even up yet and I
already contemplate emotional appeals from a cat and a smoke detector
along with a wristwatch argument from strength. Wrenching myself out of
bed, I say to the mirror what I tell it every morning: Dont take any crap
from anyone.

Back in 1974, National Lampoon published a parody comic-book version
of Platos Republic. Socrates stands around talking philosophy with a
few friends. Each time he makes a point, another guy concedes, Yes,
Socrates, very well put. In the next frame you see an explosive POW!!!
and the opponent goes flying through the air. Socrates wins by a knockout.
The Lampoons Republic has some historical validity; ancient Greeks,
like argumentative nerds throughout the ages, loved to imagine themselves
as fighters. But even they knew the real-life difference
between fighting and arguing. We should, too.

Debate and battle
We need to distinguish rhetorical argument from the share the same Latin
root. Typical of those blame-shifting, he-said-she-said squabbling that de- pugnacious Romans.
fines conflict today. In a fight, each disputant tries to
win. In an argument, they try to win over an audiencewhich can comprise
the onlookers, television viewers, an electorate, or each other.
This chapter will help you distinguish between an argument and a fight,
and to choose what you want to get out of an argument. The distinction can
determine the survival of a marriage, as the celebrated research psychologist
John Gottman proved in the eighties and nineties. Working out of his
love lab at the University of Washington, he and his assistants videotaped
hundreds of married couples over a period of nine years, poring over every
tape and entering every perceived emotion and logical point into a database.
They watched hours and days and months of arguments, of couples

glaring at each other and revealing embarrassing things in front of the
camera. It was like a bad reality show.
When Gottman announced his findings in 1994, though, rhetoricians
around the country tried not to look smug, because the data confirmed
what rhetoric has claimed for several millennia. Gottman found that
couples who stayed married over those nine years argued about as much as
those who ended up in divorce. However, the successful couples went about
their arguments in a different way, and with a different purpose. Rhetoricians
would say they instinctively followed the basic tenets of argument.
When some of the videotapes appeared on network television, they
showed some decidedly uncomfortable moments, even among the happy
couples. One successfully married husband admitted he was pathologically
lazy, and his wife cheerfully agreed. Nonetheless, the couples who stayed
married seemed to use their disputes to solve problems and work out differences.
They showed faith in the outcome. The doomed couples, on the
other hand, used their sessions to attack each other. Argument was a problem
for them, not a means to a solution. The happy ones argued. The unhappy
ones fought.
Much of the time, Im guessing that the happy ones also seducedthey
manipulated one another. Thats a good thing. While our culture tends

You succeed in an argument when you persuade your audience. You win
a fight when you dominate the enemy. A territorial dispute in the backseat
of a car fails to qualify as argument, for example, unless each child makes
the unlikely attempt to persuade instead of scream. (I see your point, sister.
However, have you considered the analogy of the international frontier?)

At the age of two, my son, George, became a devotee of what rhetoricians
call argument by the stick; when words failed him, he used his fists.
After every fight I would ask him: Did you get the other kid to agree with
you? For years he considered that to be a thoroughly stupid question, and
maybe it was. But eventually it made sense to him: argument by the stick
fightingis no argument. It never persuades, it only inspires revenge or
retreat.
In a fight, one person takes out his aggression on another. Vice President
Dick Cheney was fighting when he urged U.S. senator Pat Leahy to
commit an autoerotic act on the Senate floor. Cheney said this spleen venting
made him feel better, but it wasnt an argument. (It would have been
one if Cheney really wanted Leahy to do what he suggested, God forbid.)
On the other hand, when George Foreman tries to sell you a grill, he
makes an argument: persuasion that tries to change your mood, your mind,
or your willingness to do something.
Homer Simpson offers a legitimate argument when he demonstrates
our intellectual superiority to dolphins: Dont forgetwe invented computers,
leg warmers, bendy straws, peel-and-eat shrimp, the glory hole, and
the pudding cup.
Mariah Carey pitches an argument when she sings, We belong together,
to an assumed ex-boyfriend; she tries to change his mind (and

How to Seduce a Cop
A police patrol stops you on the highway and you roll your window down.
you: Whats wrong, Officer?
cop: Did you know that the speed limit here is fifty?
you: How fast was I going?
cop: Fifty-five.
The temptation to reply with a snappy answer is awful.
you: Whoa, lock me up!
And indeed the satisfaction might be worth the speeding ticket and risk
of arrest. But rewind the scene and pause it where the cop says fifty-five.

Stimulating emotions puts the other goals within range. When Frank
Capra directed Its a Wonderful Life, he had a problem persuading a shy
Jimmy Stewart to kiss Donna Reed. Stewart kept making excuses to put off
the scene. Capra finally threw away the script, which had the two actors listening
over separate extensions to the girls asinine boyfriend. Instead, the
director made the couple share the same phone. The physical contact did
the trick; you can almost see a hormonal miasma hanging over the World
War II vet and the lovely young actress. Stewart did his duty with obvious
pleasure, completing in a single take one of the great screen kisses of all time.

the resulting consensus, everybody made out very well (so to speak).

up or down in price I recently visited her in London, where she was depending on your

there, she proposed dinner at a low-price Indian
restaurant. I wanted to play the generous dad and take her someplace
fancier. Guess who won.
me: We could still eat Indian, but someplace more upscale.
dorothy jr.: Sure.
me: So do you know of any?
dorothy jr.: Oh, Londons full of them.
me: Uh-huh. So do you know of any in particular?
dorothy jr. [vaguely]: Oh, yeah.
me: Any near here?
dorothy jr.: Not really.
me: So youd rather eat at your usual place.
dorothy jr.: If you want to, sure.
me: I dont want to!
And then I felt guilty about losing my patience, which, though she denies it,
may have been Dorothy Juniors strategy all along. We ate at her usual
place. She won, using my guilt as her emotional goal. Dorothy couldnt
have done better if she had prepared a Ciceronian speech in advance.
Cicero might even approve: the most effective rhetoric disguises itself, he
said. Dorothy knew this instinctively. She has a biting tongue but knows how
to restrain it to win an argument. Still, Dorothy had it relatively easy. We
were going to dinner one way or another. All she had to do was pull me
toward her choice.
SET YOUR GOALS 25
Goal number threein which you get an audience to do something or to
stop doing itis the most difficult. It requires a different, more personal
level of emotion. Suppose I didnt want to go to dinner at all. Dorothy would
have had a lot more arguing to do to get me out the door. Thats like getting
a horse to drink, to use an old expression. You can give the horse salt
to stimulate its desire for water (arousing its emotions,
if you will); you can persuade it to follow you to a
stream (the choice part); but getting it to commit to
drinking poses the toughest rhetorical problem.

notoriously bad at this. The kids flock to rock concerts

You have your personal goal (what you want out of the argument) and
your audience goals (mood, mind, action). Now, before you begin arguing,
ask yourself one more question: Whats the issue? According to Aristotle,
all issues boil down to just three (the Greeks were crazy about that
number):

Did O.J. do it? Blame.
Shall we dance? Choice: to dance or not to dance.
Why should you care which question slots into which core issue? It matters
because you will never meet your goals if you argue around the wrong
core issue. Watch a couple in their living room, reading books and listening
to music:
she: Can you turn that down a little?
he: Youre the one who set the volume last.
she: Oh, really? Then who was it blasting Free Bird all over
the place this afternoon?
he: So thats what this is about. You hate my music.
What does she want out of this argument? Quiet. Its a choice issue. She
wants him to choose to turn the music down. But instead of choices, the argument
turns to blame, then values.
Blame: Youre the one who set the volume last.
Values: So thats what this is about. You hate my music.
Its hard to make a positive choice about turning the volume knob when
you argue about a past noise violation and the existential qualities of
Free Bird.
The examples I gave of the core issuesblame, values, and choice
show a certain pattern. The blame questions deal with the past. The values
questions are in the present tense. And the choice questions have to do
with the future.
Blame = Past
Values = Present
Choice = Future
If you find an argument spinning out of control, try switching the tense.
To pin blame on the cheese thief, use the past tense. To get someone to
believe that abortion is a terrible sin, use the present tense. The future,
though, is the best tense for getting peace and quiet in the living room.
CONTROL THE TENSE 29
Aristotle, who devised a form of rhetoric for each of
the tenses, liked the future best of all.
The rhetoric of the past, he said, deals with issues of
justice. This is the judicial argument of the courtroom.
Aristotle called it forensic rhetoric, because it covers
forensics. Our music-challenged couple uses the past
tense for blaming each other.
he: Youre the one who set the volume last.
she: Then who was it blasting Free Bird?
If you want to try someone on charges of volume
abuse (not to mention bad taste), youre in the right
tense. Forensic argument helps us determine whodunit,
not whos-doing-it or who-will-do-it. Watch Law and

Order and youll notice that most of the dialogue is in the past tense. It
works great for lawyers and cops, but a loving couple should be wary of the
tense. The purpose of forensic rhetoric is to determine guilt and mete out
punishment; couples who get in the habit of punishing each other suffer
the same fate as the doomed marriages in Dr. Gottmans love lab.
How about the present tense? Is that any better? It can
be. The rhetoric of the present handles praise and condemnation,
separating the good from the bad, distinguishing
groups from other groups and individuals
from each other. Aristotle reserved the present for describing
people who meet a communitys ideals or fail
to live up to them. It is the communal language of commencement
addresses, funeral orations, and sermons. It
celebrates heroes or condemns a common enemy. It
gives people a sort of tribal identity. (Were great, terrorists
are cowards). When a leader has trouble confronting
the future, you hear similar tribal talk.

Aristotles term for this kind of language is demonstrative rhetoric, because
ancient orators used it to demonstrate their fanciest techniques. Our
argumentative couple uses it to divide each other.
he: So thats what this is about. You hate my music.

Present-tense (demonstrative) rhetoric tends to finish with people

Past-tense (forensic) rhetoric threatens punishment.
Future-tense (deliberative) argument promises a payoff. You can
see why Aristotle dedicated the rhetoric of decision making to
the future.
Our poor couple remains stranded in the present tense, so lets rewind
their dialogue and make them speak deliberativelyin the future tense,
that is.

By turning the argument back to choices, the man keeps it from getting

vulnerable to persuasion.

CONTROL THE TENSE 33
All we have for the future is conjecture or choices, not facts. When
Homer Simpson argues with his wife in the future tense of deliberative
argument, facts have nothing to do with it:
marge: Homer, I dont want you driving around in a car you
built yourself.
homer: You can sit there complaining, or you can knit me
some seat belts.
Instead of helping us to find some elusive truth, deliberative argument
deliberates, weighing one choice against the other, considering the circumstances.
Choices:
Beach, or mountains, this summer?
Should your company replace its computers, or hire a
competent tech staff ?
Will Frodo come out as a gay Hobbit?
Should we invade Iraq?
When you argue about values, you use demonstrative
rhetoric, not deliberative. If you rely on a
cosmic authorityGod, or Bonothen the audience
has no choice to make.
Eternal truths will answer these:
Is there a God?
Is homosexuality immoral?
Is capitalism bad?
Should all students know the Ten
Commandments?
In each case the argument has to rely on morals
and metaphysics. And it takes place mostly in
the present tense, the language of demonstrative
rhetoric. It can be particularly maddening in a
marital dispute, because it comes across as preachy.
(Demonstrative rhetoric is the rhetoric of preachers,
after all.) Besides, it is far more difficult to

Practical concerns, on the other hand, are open to deliberative debate.
Because deliberation has to do with choices, everything about it depends
on the circumstances, the time, the people involved, and whatever public
you mean when you talk about public opinion. Deliberative argument relies
on public opinion to resolve questions, not a higher power.
The audiences opinion will answer these:
Should the state legislature raise taxes to fund decent schools?
Should you raise your kids allowance?
When should your company release its newest product?
If you reply, Thats just wrong! to an argument, you use demonstrative,
values rhetoric. If you reply, On the other hand, then your argument has
a chance of making a choice.
father: Our kid could break her neck on those old monkey
bars.
mother: On the other hand, she may not. Besides, the coordination
she learns might prevent future accidents.
And it might not. Choices are full of these what-if scenarios, and deliberative
discourse deals with their probabilities. In The Simpsonsan endless

Moe the bartender with demonstrative, present-tense rhetoric, and

Deliberation is the rhetoric of choice, literally. It deals with decisions,
and decisions depend on particular circumstances, not eternal truths and
cold facts. If life were free of contingencies, then we could live by a few

it doesnt. Sometimes, under some circumstances (say, jumping out of an

Sometimes the enemy of your enemy makes a terrible friend.

The strangely triumphant art of agreeability
Audi partem alteram.
Hear the other side. saint augustine
At the age of seven, my son, George, insisted on wearing shorts to school
in the middle of winter. We live in icy New Hampshire, where playground
snow has all the fluffy goodness of ground glass. My wife launched
the argument in the classic family manner: You talk to him, she said.
So I talked to him. Being a student of rhetoric, I employed Aristotles
three most powerful tools of persuasion:
Argument by character
Argument by logic
Argument by emotion
In this chapter you will see how each of these tools works, and youll
gain some techniquesthe persuasive use of decorum, argument jujitsu,
tactical sympathythat will put you well on the way to becoming an argument
adept.
The first thing I used on George was argument by character: I gave him
my stern father act.
me: You have to wear pants, and thats final.
george: Why?
me: Because I told you to, thats why.
But he just looked at me with tears in his eyes. Next, I tried reasoning
with him, using argument by logic.
SOFTEN THEM UP 39
me: Pants will keep your legs from chapping. Youll feel a lot
better.
george: But I want to wear shorts.
So I resorted to manipulating his emotions. Following Cicero, who
claimed that humor was one of the most persuasive of all rhetorical passions,
I hiked up my pant legs and pranced around.
me: Doh-de-doh, look at me, here I go off to work wearing
shorts . . . Dont I look stupid?
george: Yes. (Continues to pull shorts on.)
me: So why do you insist on wearing shorts yourself ?
george: Because I dont look stupid. And theyre my legs. I
dont mind if they get chaffed.
me: Chapped.
Superior vocabulary and all, I seemed to be losing my case. Besides,
George was making his first genuine attempt to argue instead of cry. So I
decided to let him win this one.
me: All right. You can wear shorts in school if your mother
and I can clear it with the authorities. But you have to put
your snow pants on when you go outside.  Useful Figure

Aristotles Big Three
I used my best arguments by character, logic, and emotion. So, how did
George still manage to beat me? By using the same tools. I did it on pur -
pose, and he did it instinctively. Aristotle called them logos, ethos, and pathos;
40 THANK YOU FOR ARGUING
and so will I, because their meanings are richer than the English versions.
Together they form the three basic tools of rhetoric.
Logos is argument by logic. If arguments were children,
logos would be the brainy one, the big sister who  Argument Tool

logical rules; instead, its techniques use what the audi -
ence itself is thinking.
Ethos, or argument by character, employs the persuaders personality,
reputation, and ability to look trustworthy. (While logos sweats over its GPA,
ethos gets elected class president.) In rhetoric, a sterling
reputation is more than just good; its persuasive. I  Argument Tool

suasive. An audience is more likely to believe a trustworthy
persuader, and to accept his argument. A persons life persuades better
than his word, said one of Aristotles contemporaries. This remains true
today. Rhetoric shows how to shine a flattering light on your life.
Then you have pathos, or argument by emotion,  Argument Tool

thing more combustible.
Logos, ethos, and pathos appeal to the brain, gut, and heart of your audience.
While our brain tries to sort the facts, our gut tells us whether we can
trust the other person, and our heart makes us want to do something about
it. They form the essence of effective persuasion.

ical terminology didnt: proposal at the end?
SOFTEN THEM UP 41
me: Pants will make your legs feel better.
george: I dont mind if they get chaffed.
Finally, I found his pathos irresistible. When he was little, the kid would
actually stick his lower lip out when he tried not to cry. Cicero loved this
techniquenot the lip part, but the appearance of struggling for selfcontrol.
It serves actually to amplify the mood in the room. Cicero also said
a genuine emotion persuades more than a faked one; and Georges tears
certainly were genuine. Trying not to cry just made his eyes well up more.
I wish I could say my pathos was as effective, but George failed to think it
funny when I hiked my pants up. He just agreed that I looked stupid. I had
been studying rhetoric pretty intensively at that point, and to be thrown
to the mat by a seven-year-old was humiliating. So was facing my wife
afterward.
dorothy: So did you talk to him?
me: Yeah, I handled it.
George picked that moment to walk into the room with his shorts on.
dorothy: Then why is he wearing shorts?
george: We made a deal!
dorothy: A deal. Which somehow allows him to wear shorts
to school.
me: I told you, I handled it.
So what if his legs looked like rhubarbs when he came home? While I
was moderately concerned about the state of his skin, and more apprehensive
about living up to Dorothys expectations, neither had much to do with
my personal goal: to raise persuasive children. If George was willing to put
all he had into an argument, I was willing to concede. That time, I like to
think, we both won. (Today he expresses his individuality in the opposite
way: he wears ties to school. And pants, even.)
Logos, pathos, and ethos usually work together to win an argument, debates
with argumentative seven-year-olds excepted. By using your opponents
logic and your audiences emotion, you can win over your audience
with greater ease. You make them happy to let you control the argument.
42 THANK YOU FOR ARGUING
Logos: Use the Logic in the Room
Later on, well get into rhetorics more dramatic logical tactics and show
how to bowl your audience over with your eloquence. First, though, lets
master the most powerful logos tool of all, concession. It seems more Jedi
knight than Rambo, involving more self-mastery than brute force, but it lies
closer to the power center of logos than rhetorics more grandiloquent
methods. Even the most aggressive maneuvers allow room for the opponents
ideas and the audiences preconceptions. To persuade peopleto
make them desire your choice and commit to the action you wantyou
need all the assets in the room, and one of the best resources comes
straight from your opponents mouth.

Logos: Argument by logic. The first logical tactic we covered was
concession, using the opponents argument to your own

Pathos: Argument by emotion. The most important pathetic tactic
is sympathy, registering concern for your audiences emotions
and then changing the mood to suit your argument.
Ethos: Argument by character. Aristotle called this the most important

The agreeable side of ethos
He who is unable to live in society, or who has no need because he is sufficient for
himself, must be either a beast or a god. aristotle
An agreeable ethos matches the audiences expectations for a leaders
tone, appearance, and manners. The ancient Romans coined a word
to describe this kind of character-based agreeability: decorum. The concept

neighborhood bar. This is why salespeople wear terrific shoes, and why a sixteen-
year-old girl will sneak out of the house to get a navel ring. She fits herself
into a social microhabitat that happens to exclude her mortified parents.
Actually, the Latin word decorum meant fit, as in suitable. In argument,
as in evolution, survival belongs to the fittest. The elite of every society

misery.
We think of decorum as a fussy, impractical art, but the manuals the ancients
wrote on decorumcovering voice control, gestures, clothing, and
timing, as well as mannerstouted the same themes as a modern best
seller, combining the contents of How to Dress for Success, Martha Stewart,
Emily Post, and The One-Minute Manager. A couple of thousand years after
the Romans invented it, modern rhetorician Kenneth Burke declared that
decorum is perhaps the simplest case of persuasion. He went on to offer a
good inventory of decorous skills:
You persuade a man only insofar as you can talk his language by
speech, gesture, tonality, order, image, attitude, idea, identifying
your ways with his.
Burke wrote that in 1950, by the wayback when it was perfectly decorous
to refer to a person as a man, a usage that most people today would
consider rude. Does that mean we grow more polite every year? Few people
over eighteen seem to think so. But that doesnt mean we have grown
ruder, either. Every era has its rules; humans continuously adapt those rules
to changes in the social environment. Men used to wear coat and tie to the
movies, but they also smoked in them.
Speaking of movies, my mother was fourteen when Gone with the Wind
came to the local theater in Wayne, Pennsylvania. Rhett Butlers profanity
was all the buzz back then. Mom was looking forward to hearing someone
actually curse in a movie, but when the time came for Frankly, my dear, I
dont give a damn, the audience gasped and whispered so much that she
never heard it. The line was quite a shocker, she said many years later.
These days every middle school student talks like a sailor. Score one for
the superior politeness of my mothers generation. On the other hand,
when Mom watched Gone with the Wind, she had to sit in the balcony; she
went with the familys cook, who was black. Even in suburban Philadelphia,
back in 1939, while Gone with the Wind reminisced about the chivalrous
South, theaters banned coloreds from the good seats.
What are manners but the ways we treat one another? People who
48 THANK YOU FOR ARGUING
complain about political correctness may just be lamenting inevitable
change in the social environment. Sure, some people love to enforce manners;

Go ahead and tell it like it is. But you cannot be indecorous and persuasive
at the same time. The two are mutually exclusive.
Deliberative argument is not about the truth, its about choices, and
persuasive decorum changes to match the audience. When in Rome, do as
the Romans do; but when youre not in Rome, doing as the Romans do
might get you in trouble. Decorum can make the difference between persuading
an audience and getting thrown out by it.
One of the greatest decorum scenes in movie history graces the climax
of 8 Mile, Eminems semiautobiography. He gets talked into a competition
at a dance club in downtown Detroit where hip-hop artists (orators, if you
will) take turns insulting each other. The audience chooses the winner by
applause. Eventually, the contest comes down to two people: Eminem and
a sullen-looking black guy. (Well, not as sullen as Eminem. Nobody can be
that sullen.) Enimem wears proper attire: stupid skullcap, clothes a few
sizes too big, and as much bling as he can afford. If he showed up dressed
like Cary Grant, he would look terrificto you and me. But the dance club
crowd would find him wildly indecorous.
Clothing is the least of his decorum problems, though. He happens to be
white, and everyone else in the room is black. Eminem nonetheless manages
to devastate his adversary by revealing a nasty little secret: this putative

pointless, because the audience finds them phony. Eminem, that foulmouthed

his black opponent does.

It isnt always easy to adapt your decorum to the circumstances, even if
you want to. Back when I was single and living in D.C., my younger brother
came to visit me. One evening in Georgetown, center of Washingtons
nightlife, we crossed M Street to hit a few bars when a Hare Krishna approached
us with some scraggly-looking roses for sale. John bought one
and gave it to the first pretty woman he saw, saying, Here you go, doll.
Here you go, doll? Who did he think he was, Dean Martin?
Instead of smacking him, the woman said, Oh,

john: Yeah. She was cute. she was promoted to

Maybe he was onto something. Wait here, I
told him, and I jaywalked back across the street and bought another rose
from the Hare Krishna just as the light changed and a crowd of bar hoppers
came toward me, including several young women. I picked out a stunning
blond and thrust the rose at her just as John had done. I even tried to imitate
his tone.
me: Here ya go, doll.
woman: Go to hell.
She said it matter-of-factly, without any apparent rancor, the way one
might say, No thanks, to a Hare Krishna. Ive never stopped wondering
what happened. John and I look alikesame build, same hair. At any rate,
it couldnt have been my looks, because she never looked at me. Did John
GET THEM TO LIKE YOU 51
have a homing instinct for the type of female who
liked being called doll?
More likely, the one I approached sensed my embarrassment.
John is the kind of irony-free, straightahead
guy who attracts women. Im not, apparently.
Cicero would nod his head. He taught that you cant
assume a character that strays too far from your own.
What works for one can wreak disaster for the other.
Indeed, said Cicero, such diversity of character
carries with it so great significance that suicide may
be for one man a duty, for another (under the same
circumstances) a crime.
Speak for yourself, C-man. But we get the point.
 Persuasion Alert
We have been taught
that a successful persuader
never admits
ignorance, but the
Romans saw doubt
as a rhetorical device.

the audience will
unconsciously start
reasoning for you.

it, they comfortably

head.
Decorum is the art of the appropriate, and an ethos that fails to fit your
actual personality is usually indecorous. People pick up on it.
Captain Kangaroos Fashion Tip
Romans wore togas, so Cicero offers little relevant advice for us on how
to dress decorously. But the decorum rule of thumb applies to dress as well
as everything else: look the way you think your audience will want you to
look. When in doubt, use camouflage. Dress the way
the average audience member dresses. Is black the
common color in your office? Wear black. You want
to dress slightly above your rankwearing a jacket on
a casual Friday, for instancebut not too far above (a
Friday tie makes you look like a jerk in many offices).
And if youre in a persuasive situation, dont let your
clothes make a statement unless your audience will
agree with it. A camo tie might be a witty fashion
accessory in the offices of the People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals, but the PETA people may not
enjoy your indecorum.
In all honesty, Im not the best one to give fashion

Basketball Decorum in Afghanistan
Besides knowing how to dress, a decorous persuader has to know how to
adapt her language to the particular occasion. This is especially important
in business. A PowerPoint presentation needs a sophisticated sense of decorum,
because the speaker may be delivering versions of it to several different
audiences.
First, she might give it to her department head, while sitting on the edge
of the conference table and talking blue, with phrases like If this doesnt
work, were screwed or The bleeps in accounting need to support us on
this.
Next comes the presentation to the vice president. Some blunt or even
crude language might be appropriate, but sitting on the edge of the table
isnt. She sits at the table, establishing eye contact before looking up at the
screen and hitting the buttons of her remote.
When she speaks to the COO, she stands, wearing her best suit and speaking
as though she doesnt see the big boss check messages on his cell phone
and flip through the paper leave-behind version of the presentation.
On each occasion she behaves appropriately, the way the people in the
room expect her to behavenot necessarily the way the audience itself
behaves. If our presenter acted as rudely as the COO, she would get pinkslipped

Senator Bob Packwood learned the personal-is-political lesson the hard
way, with a decorum disaster that wrecked his career. One of the most effective
feminists on Capitol Hill, the Oregon Republican championed womens
rights legislation. But in 1992 word got out that he was chasing female staff
around his desk; the civil rights hero turned out to be a total horn dog.
Although he was a great public servant for women, his lack of decorum
showed how he really felt about them. Persuasion requires sympathy. His
rotten behavior made him unpersuasive. In politics, persuasion is power;
so, bereft of political capital, he eventually resigned. Packwood may have
been true to himself. Maybe, deep down, he was a horn dog. But persuasion
doesnt depend on being true to yourself. It depends on being true to your
audience.
That may sound dishonest and cynical, especially in our society. We
celebrate indecorous behavior. Because we undervalue persuasion, decorum
seems to put us at a disadvantage. When everyone around us acts like
a jerk, why should we behave? As we have seen, though, decorumrightly
understoodis a source of rhetorical strength, not weakness. It gives
people a sense of group identity, a resource that rhetoric loves to exploit.
Get the group to identify with you and you have won half the persuasive

What defines a virtuous woman (assuming anyone still

In rhetorical terms, though, virtue means
anything but. It continues to play a big role in argument;
we just avoid using the term. Instead, we talk about values.
Thats because a person who upholds the values of
a group is rhetorically virtuous. This kind of persuasive
virtue does not require purity of soul and universal
goodness. You dont even have to do what your heart
knows is right; you simply must be seen to have the right

Clearly, if you want to pack your own ethos with persuasive virtue, you

I was acting businesslike, while academics valued
scholarship. My magazine, with its class notes and stories
about life on campus, definitely wasnt scholarly.

publish a professors article in German.
me: Why German?
dean: To send a message.
me: But what if hardly anyone can read the mes -

dean: You dont get it, do you?
Now I think I get it. While I valued profit and
service to the readers, he valued scholarship and flattering
the faculty. If I had treated my job more rhetorically
and published an occasional research paper,
on-campus scholars would have found me more virtuous.
My pay probably would have improved. And the

Its not hard to pump up your rhetorical virtue for a particular audience.
I will give you a few ideas, but the essential point is to fashion yourself into
an exemplar of their values. You want to look like a good persongood,
that is, in their eyes.
The most red-blooded American technique is simply to brag about all
the good things you have done. Or you can get someone to brag for you.
You can arouse sympathy by revealing an appealing flaw (well get to that).
Or, when you find yourself on the wrong side, you can switch.
While bragging is the easiest way to show how great you are, it doesnt
always work. God, for his part, bragged to great effect in the book of Job.

from head to foot. Job finally yells to heaven.
job: Why are you punishing me? At least let me argue my
case. If you do, youll have to stop with the killing and the
boils.
It may have been the bravest thing ever said by a man with raging
dermatitis. But then a whirlwind appears out of nowhere and speaks in
Gods voice.
god: Answer me this. Where were you when I laid the foundations
of the earth? Can you rule the heavens? And the
whale: who do you think made it? What makes you think
you even know enough to argue with me?
Job backs right down. You dont mess with Gods ethos. He has virtue
to spare; in fact, he constitutes virtue. Unless you happen to be a god,
thoughor at least someone with enough power to give a State of the
Union addressreciting your rsum is not the most effective way to enhance
your ethos.
Aristotle said that character references beat your own bragging. John

their teenager gain a mutually enhanced ethos. Have
one talk up the others virtue.
father: Mind turning that down?
kid: You never let me play my music!
mother: Your father gave you that stereo.
Then there is the tactical flaw: reveal some defect
that shows your dedication to the audiences values.
George Washington was the unequaled master of
this device. Late in the Revolutionary War, his officers
grew frustrated by the Continental Congresss
delays in paying them, and they threatened mutiny.
Washington requested a meeting and showed up
with a congressional resolution that assured immediate
pay. He pulled the document from his pocket
and then fumbled with his spectacles.

bragging for you.

TACTICAL FLAW: Reveal
a weakness that wins
sympathy or shows the
sacrifice you have
made for the audience.
washington: Forgive me, gentlemen, for my eyes have grown
dim in the service of my country.
The men burst into tears and swore their fealty to the chief. It was a sentimental
time. And it was George Washington, for crying out loud. His officers
considered him to be God and Caesar rolled up in one.
Though you probably dont happen to be the
father of your country, you can use the same technique
to recover from a mistake. Turn it into a
tactical flaw by attributing your error to something
noble. Imagine you sent a memo to everyone
in your office, only to find that you screwed
up your figures by a decimal point or two.
TRY THIS IF YOURE SHORT
When a microphone is too
high for you, dont lower it
yourself. Get someone else
to do it, then say, The
great thing about being
short is you get good at
making people do things

you: Sorry, my bad. I wrote it late last night and didnt want
to wake the others to check the facts.

might work on an impressionable boss.

Virtue. Rhetorical virtue is the appearance of virtue. It can spring
from a truly noble person or be faked by the skillful rhetorician.
Rhetoric is an agnostic art; it requires more adaptation than
righteousness. You adapt to the values of your audience.
Values take on a different meaning in rhetoric as well. Rhetorical
values do not necessarily represent rightness or truth;
they merely constitute what people valuehonor, faith, steadfastness,
money, toys. Support your audiences values, and you

The tactics of practical wisdomthe rhetorical kind
They should rule who are able to rule best. aristotle
Now that we have mastered virtue and its main tool, decorum, we can
move on to the second major element of ethos: practical wisdom. I can
think of no better way to illustrate this streetwise rhetorical knowledge
than Animal House. After Dean Wormer expels the fraternity, John Belushis
Bluto addresses his brothers with a passionate oration.
bluto: Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?
Hell no! And it aint over now. Cause when the goin gets
tough . . . the tough get goin! Whos with me? Lets go!
He runs from the room, and nobody moves. How come? While it could
use some fact checking, the speech is not so bad. Bluto uses several timetested
logical and emotional devices: the good old rhetorical question, the
popular if well-worn chiasmus (When the going gets tough . . .), and a
rousing call to action. So why does it fail?
The three traits of ethosvirtue, practical wisdom, and goodwillshow
why the speech bombs. Bluto is the classic likable knucklehead; he lacks
practical wisdom, the appearance of knowing what to do. He offers no idea
about what should happen after he runs out. So why follow him? (He leaves
a wiser character, Otter, to propose a really futile and stupid gesture.)
Blutos ethos is not all bad, however. His interest is their interest, particularly
their interest for revenge.
bluto: Im not gonna take this. Wormer, hes a dead man!
Marmalard, dead!
SHOW LEADERSHIP 67
He wants what they want, and once Otter gives them a plan, they all pull
together to sabotage the homecoming paradea successful consensus.
(According to the credits, Bluto eventually becomes a U.S. senator, understandably.)
In short, he has plenty of selfless goodwill; Otter makes up for
Blutos lack of practical wisdom; and as for virtue, well, as you saw with
decorum, almost anything can seem good and proper, depending on the
occasion.
You have seen how much depends on the audience. The persuader
must recognize what they believe, sympathize with their feelings, and fit in
with their expectationscharacteristics of logos, pathos, and ethos. All right,
so Bluto clearly believes in what his brothers believe: nothing. Well, anarchy
at any rate. He has the same feeling of wounded pride and injustice. He not
only fits in, he personally bestowed names on each of the freshmen. He has
the whole package of logos, pathos, and ethos, right?
Not exactly. He suffers a major ethos malfunction here. Its not enough
simply to blend in with the brothers. Before they follow Bluto, they have to
consider him worth following.
When you seem to share your audiences values, they believe you will
apply them to whatever choice you help them make. If evangelical Protestants
think you want to do what Jesus would do, they probably will find you
trustworthy. If an environmentalist considers you earth-centric, she will respect
your thinking about the proposed new power plant. But sharing your
audiences values is not sufficient. They also have to believe that you know
the right thing to do at that particular moment. While an evangelical Christian
will respect you for trying to do what Jesus would do, he still wont let
you remove his appendix.
This kind of trust is where practical wisdom comes  Argument Tool
in. The audience should consider you a sensible per- PRACTICAL WISDOM:

the problem at hand. When you remove an appendix, solve the problem
at hand. Aristotles
a medical degree proves your practical wisdom more word for this kind of
than your knowledge of the Bible. wisdom is phronesis.
Practical wisdom entails the sort of common sense
that can get things done. A persuader who shows it tends to be more
Edison than Einstein, more Han Solo than Yoda. Look at past presidents,
and you can see what Aristotle meant. John Adams, Herbert Hoover, and
Jimmy Carter were among our most intellectually endowed presidents.
68 THANK YOU FOR ARGUING
They were also among the least effective, being gifted with more IQ than
street smarts.
Practical wisdom does not entail looking up decisions in books, or sticking
to universal truths. Its an instinct for making the right decision on every
occasion. Pure eggheads lack it. When we think of the Apollo space program,
we rarely picture the rocket scientists. We remember a failed mission
Apollo 13 when three guys jury-rigged their spaceship and got back to
earth alive. They were among the most highly trained people ever to leave
the ground, but they had little training in the repair of carbon dioxide
scrubbers. Still, they were able to combine instructions from the ground
with their skill as first-class tinkerers. Thats practical wisdom: flexibly wise
leadership. All great heroes have it.
Strict rule followers lack it. Straitlaced Captain William Blighs command
of the Bounty was mediocre, to put it mildly; but after mutineers left
him and eighteen men in a twenty-three-foot launch, he pulled off one of
the greatest feats of navigation in history, steering an open boat more than
thirty-six hundred nautical miles to safety. When he led by following rules,
he failed; when he applied his navigational skills to solve a practical problem,
he became a hero. He finally showed practical wisdom.
To get an audience to trust your decision, you can use three tools.
Show off your experience. If you debate a war and youre a veteran
yourself, bring it up. Ive been in battle, you say. I know what its like. In
an argument, experience usually trumps book learning. And it is fine to

Using selflessness for personal gain
To be not as eloquent would be more eloquent. christoph martin wieland
The third ethos asset, which Aristotle called disinterested goodwill,
combines selflessness and likability. Think of a friend picking up the
dinner tab. The benevolent persuader shares everything with his audience:
riches, effort, values, and mood. He feels their pain and makes them believe
he has nothing personal at stake. In other words, he shows himself to
be disinterestedfree of any special interest.
Most people use disinterest and uninterest interchangeably today. But
in earlier times, a reputation for selflessness determined whether a politician
got elected. In The Federalist, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John
Jay not only wrote anonymous letters in favor of the proposed new Constitution;
they were so eager to disguise their interest

Cicero said you want them to be attentive, trusting, and willing to be persuaded.

does this attitude come from? The same perceived traits: virtue, practical

Honest Abes Shameless Trick
While your audience must think you have these noble attributes, that does
not mean you must have them in reality. Even if you are chock-full of virtue,
street smarts, and selflessness, if your audience doesnt believe that you are,
then you have a character problem. Your soul may rise to heaven but your
ethos sucks. On the other hand, every character has its flaws, which is where
the rhetorical trickery comes in. The best trick of all:
Make it seem you have no tricks.
One of the chief rhetoricians of the early Roman Empire, a Spaniard
named Quintilian, explained.
A speaker might choose to feign helplessness by pretending to be

Holzer.
Modern persuasion research confirms Quintilians dubious theory: a
knowledgeable audience tends to sympathize with a clumsy speaker and
even mentally argue his case for him. Dubitatio also lowers expectations and
causes opponents to misunderestimate you, as Bush (a master of dubitatio)
puts it. Lincolns country-bumpkin image disguised a brilliant political
analyst who could speak lucidly about the issues. His ethos made the audience
trust his sincerity while doubting his intellectuntil he showed them
his intellect.
You can use the same technique without being a Lincoln. When you
give a talk to a group, begin hesitantly, and gradually get smoother as you
go. Speakers often think they have to grab the audiences attention right
off the bat. Not necessarily; most people start with an attention span of at
least five minutes. Just make sure your pauses dont stretch too far; legend
has it that a Dartmouth president known for his thoughtful silences gave a
speech at MIT with such a long hiatus that the host finally felt compelled to
nudge him. He promptly fell to the floor; the podium apparently had been
propping him up. He wasnt thoughtful, he was dead. Still, as long as you
and your audience have a heartbeat, a slow beginning works better than the
classic opening joke.
You can use a subtler form of dubitatio in a one-on-one argument. It
works like this: When your partner finishes talking, look down. Speak softly
WIN THEIR TRUST 77
and slowly until youre ready to make your main point. Then stare intensely
into the eyes of the other person. Get the technique right, and it can convey
passionate sincerity. My son will testify to this form of personal dubitatio.
I had described it to him a year or so back when I was researching Quintilian,
and forgot I ever mentioned it; then, several weeks ago, he came home
from school looking pleased with himself.

Matt Damons Pathetic Joke
Done properly, the ancient Sophists said, pathos affects an audiences judgment.
Recent neurological research has confirmed their theory; the seat of
the emotions, the limbic system, tends to overpower the more rational parts
of the brain. As Aristotle observed, reality looks different under different
emotions; a change for the better, for example, can look bad to a depressed
man. Protagoras, a famous Sophist, said that food tastes bitter to an invalid
and the opposite to a healthy person. While the doctor makes changes
with drugs, he said, the Sophist does it with words.
Words can indeed act like a drug, though to paraphrase Homer Simpson,
what works even more like a drug is drugs. Aristotle, that rational old
soul, preferred to modify peoples emotions through

their beliefs. Emotions actually come from belief, he ITLL FEEL GREAT

That didnt scare you, did it? Your disbelief kept you from fear. Emotion
comes from experience and expectationwhat your audience believes
has happened, or will take place in the future. The more vividly you
give the audience the sensations of an experience, the greater the emotion
you can arouse.
CONTROL THE MOOD 81
Suppose you wanted to make me angry at your next-door neighbor. You
could tell me what a jerk she isthat she flirts in front of her husband and
watches bad TV. None of this would make me angry at her. You describe
her personality, not an experience. To make me angry, give me a vivid description
of a specific outrage.
you: She called the Boy Scouts a fascist organization.
me: Well, shes entitled to her
you: On Halloween? When my little boy comes to her stoop
wearing his older brothers uniform?
me: How do you
you: I was there. When he started to cry, she said, If you turn
out to be gay, youll be glad you met me. Then she looked
straight at me and slammed the door.
That would make me angry at the neighbor. You re-created a dramatic
scene, making me see it through your eyes. This works much better than
name-calling. You made me believe the woman did something mean to an
innocent little boy.

Other Passion Plays
Humor ranks above all the other emotions in persuasiveness, in part because
it works the best at improving your ethos. A sense of humor not only
calms people down, it makes you appear to stand above petty squabbles.
The problem with humor, though, is that it is perfectly awful at motivating
anyone into any sort of action. When people laugh, they rarely want to do
anything else. Humor can change their emotions and their minds, but the
persuasion stops there.

stand in a group, and how much they belong to it. I mentioned in an earlier
chapter that you want the audience to identify with you and, through you,
the action you promote. We will delve further into identification in a later
chapter. But its enough to know that action requires identification. This is
why Aristotle listed anger, patriotism, and emulation among emotions that
can get an audience out of its seats and make it do what you want.
A person who desires something is especially susceptible to anger. Frustrate
her ability to assuage that desire, Aristotle said, and you have an angry

have more desires than old people, so they rouse to anger more easily. Ditto

The easiest way to stimulate anger, Aristotle went on, is to belittle that
desire. Keep in mind that he lived in a culture that re-

this in magazines:
when readers see
short, witty letters to
the editor, they write
short, witty letters.
When your audience is only one person, though, you had better know your
logos. And you dont want to overplay your emotions.
That goes for announcing them as well as projecting them. Emotions
should sneak up on people, especially if your audience doesnt already feel
them. For that reason, never announce the mood you
foster. Anyone who has ever told a joke knows not to
proclaim its humor in advance. As they say in writing
classes, show, dont tell. Yet people still hype emotions
before they introduce them. My son was guilty of this
just the other day, when he came home in a bad mood
and found me in a perverse one.

THE UNANNOUNCED
EMOTION: Dont
advertise a mood.
Invoke it.
george: I heard something today thats going to make you
really mad.
me: No it wont.
george: How do you know?
me: It wont make me mad if Im prepared for it.
george: Will you let me talk?
me: Sure. I just wont get mad.
george: Dad, just shut up!
dorothy sr.: Dont speak to your father that way.
By giving me advance warning of an emotion, George inoculated me
from it. But he was unprepared to get mad himself. Its amazing how much
fun it is to manipulate emotions.

The Tools
Rhetorical tradition has it that when Cicero spoke, people said, What a
great speech. When the fiery Athenian orator Demosthenes spoke, people
said, Lets march! The Greek spoke more pathetically than the Roman;
emotion makes the difference between agreement and commitment. Use
the tools of pathos to rouse your audience to action.
Belief: To stir an emotion, use what your audience has experienced
and what it expects to happen.
Storytelling: A well-told narrative gives the audience a virtual experience
especially if it calls on their own past experiences, and
if you tell it in the first person.
Volume control: You can often portray an emotion most effectively
by underplaying it, in an apparent struggle to contain yourself.
Even screaming demagogues like Hitler almost invariably began
a speech quietly and then turned up the volume.
Simple speech: Dont use fancy language when you get emotional.
Ornate speech belongs to ethos and logos; plain speaking is more
pathetic.
Anger often arises from a sense of belittlement. You can direct an
audiences fury at someone by portraying his lack of concern
over their problems.
Patriotism attaches a choice or action to the audiences sense of
group identity. You can stir it by comparing the audience with a
successful rival.
Emulation responds emotionally to a role model. The greater your
ethos, the more the audience will imitate you.
Unannounced emotion lets you sneak up on your audiences mood.
Dont tip them off in advance. Theyll resist the emotion.

Transforming anger into receptiveness
Even if you persuade me, you wont persuade me. aristophanes
This talk of pathetic manipulation will make the argument-squeamish
uncomfortable. If only the world could follow formulas and conduct its
affairs scientifically. But in actuality, even scientists
regularly employ a pathetic trick. Their writing uses a
thousands-year-old rhetorical device to calm the passions,
the passive voice. The experiment was conducted
upon thirty domestic rhesus monkeys, says
the researcher who did the experiment on monkeys.
When you think about it, scientists seem almost childish
pretending their work somehow just happened.
They behave like the golfer who looks away innocently
as he nudges his ball toward the hole. The
technique works to calm the emotions because it disembodies
the speaker and removes the actors, as if
whatever happened was what insurers piously call an
act of God. Of course, it also can serve as a political
subterfuge.
Creationists use the passive voice as a sneaky
weapon against science. Lehigh University biologist
Michael Behe, a leading proponent of intelligent
design, argues that some biological phenomena are
too complex for Darwinism to explain.
Perhaps molecular machines appear to look
designed because they really are designed.

THE PASSIVE VOICE:

ANGRY BOARD
The passive voice can
help you describe
wrongdoing by a friend
or coworker while
calming the audience:
The account got
fouled up, not, Marcia
fouled up the account.
Just dont use the passive
voice when you are
the culprit. If your audience
sees through your
ruse, you want them
thinking youre just
defending a coworker,
not weaseling out of
something yourself.
Elected officials who

By whom? Steve Jobs? The intelligent design crowd presents a difficult
target. They dont have to defend their Designer in Chief, because they
have taken care not to drag him into the argument. With God out of the
picture, molecular machines were created. (It would be uncharacteristic
for the Old Testament Jehovah to use the passive voice himself.)
The passive voice encourages passivity. It calms the audience, which
makes it a great pathos trick. That hardly argues for its users objectivity.
Still, you have to applaud scientists for at least trying to be objective. Science
determines facts, and emotions would only get in the way. But as we
have seen, deliberative argument has a touchier relationship with the facts.
Kick My Ass or Ill Tell a Joke
Suppose your audience has already worked itself into an emotional state,
and that state happens to be raging angeragainst you. The passive voice
may not be enough here. A dose of mild humor could reduce the tension,
as you will see in a bit. Anything that neutralizes an acidic mood with a little
basic calm cant hurt.
But a riskier, sneakier, and far more enjoyable technique does just the
opposite: set a backfire. Artie Fufkin, the publicist in This Is Spinal Tap,
does a superb backfire defense when no one shows up for a record signing.
artie: Do me a favor. Just kick my ass, okay?

Humor is much saferprovided that you use the right kind. Sigmund
Freud said that making people laugh relieves anxiety by releasing impulses
in a disciplined manner. The wisest rhetoricians

If you ever get a chance, take a look at his book Jokes
(Der Witz). Its hilariously full of unfunny jokes. (Prisoner on his way to the
gallows: Well, this is a good beginning to the week.)
Although the rhetoricians found it hard to teach, they had a good time
codifying it. One type of humor may work better for you than the others.
Urbane humor depends on an educated audience; it relies on word
play. When British general Charles Napier captured the Indian province of
Sind in 1843, he alerted his superiors with a one-word  Persuasion Alert

you can teach yourself. If you lack a sense of humor otherwise, the urbane
version makes a reasonable substitute.
Wit isnt ha-ha funny either, just mildly amusing. Its humor is drier than
urbanity, and instead of wordplay, it plays off the situation. When Chief Justice
John Roberts worked for Ronald Reagan, the White House asked his
advice on whether the president should send the Irish ambassador a Saint
Patricks Day greeting on stationery printed with An Teach Ban (Gaelic for
The White House). Roberts said he saw no legal problem, but he encouraged
the staff to fact-check the Gaelic. For all I know it means Free the
I.R.A.,  he wrote. Not ha-ha-funny. But rather witty.
Facetious humor, which covers most jokes, is supposed to make you
laugh. That is its sole purpose. Rhetoricians through the ages have frowned
on this kind of funny. If your ethos is on par with Calvin Coolidges, joke
telling could win you the sympathy of your audiencebut only if you have
a staff of professional yuck scribes, as Laura Bush did before her famous
send-up of her husband at the White House Correspondents Dinner in
2005. The former school librarian told what ABC News claimed to be the
first public joke ever by a First Lady about the president of the United
States engaged in intimate contact with a randy male horse. The crowd
went wild, and the presidents own ratings got a boost.
A joke can defuse a touchy argument, if only through sheer distraction.
If its funny enough, people will forget what they were talking about.
Banter is a form of attack and defense consisting of clever insults
and snappy comebacks. The traditional African-American game of snaps offers
the most competitive banter today. The object is to out-insult your
opponent.

But thats demonstrative rhetoric. When you use deliberative argument,
you might prefer to banter with concession, agreeing with a point only to
use it against your opponent. Cicero cited an example during a trial in the
Forum, when a brash young man used concession to rebut an elder:
elder: What you are barking at, pup?
young man: I see a thief.

The Tools
Passive voice: If you want to direct an audiences anger away from
someone, imply that the action happened on its own. The chair
got broken, not Pablo broke the chair.
Backfire: You can calm an individuals emotion in advance by overplaying
it yourself. This works especially well when you screw up
and want to prevent the wrath of an authority.
Humor: Laughter is a wonderful calming device, and it can
enhance your ethos if you use it properly. Urbane humor plays
off a word or part of speech. Wit is situational humor. Facetious
humor is joke telling, a relatively ineffective form of persuasion.
Banter, the humor of snappy answers, works best in rhetorical
defense. It uses concession to throw the opponents argument
back at him.
